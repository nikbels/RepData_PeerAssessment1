## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# Loading and preprocessing the data

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

temp <- tempfile()
download.file("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip", temp)
con <- unz(temp, "activity.csv")

given_data<-read.csv(con)
data_na_rm<-na.omit(given_data) 
```

Question 1.
#What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

Histogram of total steps taken per day.
```{r}
### What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

grp_data_1 <- data_na_rm %>% group_by(date) %>% summarise(total_steps_per_day = sum(steps))
with(grp_data_1, hist(total_steps_per_day))
```

mean and median steps taken per day.

```{r}
mean_steps<-mean(grp_data_1[["total_steps_per_day"]])
median_steps<-median(grp_data_1[["total_steps_per_day"]])
```

Mean steps taken per day are `r mean_steps`
Median steps taken per day are `r median_steps`



Question 2.
#What is the average daily activity pattern?

Time series plot of the 5-minute interval and avg steps per interval.
```{r}
grp_data_2 <- data_na_rm %>% group_by(interval) %>% summarise(avg_steps_per_interval = mean(steps))
with(grp_data_2, plot(interval, avg_steps_per_interval, type = "l"))
```

The 5-minute interval containing max. avg steps.

```{r}
max_interval<-grp_data_2[["interval"]][grp_data_2[["avg_steps_per_interval"]]==max(grp_data_2[["avg_steps_per_interval"]])]
```

The 5-minute interval with the max. avg steps is `r max_interval`



Question 3.
#Imputing missing values etc.

3.1
#Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset

```{r}
summary(given_data)
```


# Only the variable 'steps' contains NA values. 

```{r}
total_na_values<-length(which(given_data[["steps"]] %in% NA))
```

The total number of NA values in the steps variable is `r total_na_values`

3.2

#Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.

# Strategy for imputation: in place of the NA values, put the mean value of the corresponding 5-min 
# interval. For this, let's first remove all NA values and find out the means of all 5-min intervals.
This is already done in Question 2 so we will just reuse and rename the corresponding variable.

```{r}
mean_data<-grp_data_2
```

# Now substitute these median values in the corresponding NA values.
# For ex. if the variable "steps" is NA and the value of the corresponding 5-min interval is say 10.
# Then the NA value would be substituted by the median value of "steps" for the 5-min interval "10".

```{r}
intervals<-mean_data[["interval"]]
substitution_data <- given_data %>% filter(is.na(steps)) %>% rowwise() %>% 
mutate(steps = mean_data[["avg_steps_per_interval"]][which(intervals %in% interval)])

rest_data<-given_data %>% filter(!is.na(steps)) 

total_new_data<-rbind(rest_data, substitution_data)
```

3.3
# Now the histogram of the total number of steps taken each day.

```{r}
grp_data_3 <- total_new_data %>% group_by(date) %>% summarise(total_steps_per_day = sum(steps))
with(grp_data_3, hist(total_steps_per_day))
```

# mean & median of total steps per day for the new dataset.

```{r}
mean_steps_again<-mean(grp_data_3[["total_steps_per_day"]])
median_steps_again<-median(grp_data_3[["total_steps_per_day"]])
```

Mean steps per day for newly imputed dataset are `r mean_steps_again`
Median steps per day for newly imputed dataset are `r median_steps_again`


Question 4.
### Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
### For this part the weekdays() function may be of some help here. 
### Use the dataset with the filled-in missing values for this part.

```{r}
total_new_data_new <- total_new_data %>% mutate(day = weekdays(as.Date(date))) %>% 
rowwise() %>% mutate(state = factor(ifelse(day %in% c("Sunday", "Saturday"), "Weekend", "Weekday")))
grp_data_4 <- total_new_data_new %>% group_by(interval, state) %>% summarise(avg_steps = mean(steps))
```

# Panel plot of the 5-min interval & avg steps - for weekdays and weekends.

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,1))
with(subset(grp_data_4, state == "Weekday"), plot(interval, avg_steps, type = "l", main = "5-min interval % avg steps on weekdays"))
with(subset(grp_data_4, state == "Weekend"), plot(interval, avg_steps, type = "l", main = "5-min interval % avg steps on weekends"))
```
